# 100 Days Of Python

## Introduction
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp! Over the next 100 days, I'll be re-learning Python from the ground up. 
My goal is to build a strong foundation in Python and programming principles, complete daily coding challenges, and work on several projects.
The ReadMe is purely for me so I can stay more organised in my journey
