# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price

#TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
#TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.

difference_price = (abs(float(yesterday_closing_price) - float(day_before_yesterday_price)) ) * 100 / float(yesterday_closing_price)

#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.
#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation

print(formatted_articles[1])
print(formatted_articles[2])



    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio. 



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
